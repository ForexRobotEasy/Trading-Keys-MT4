## Description

The Trading Keys MT4 Forex Risk Calculator is a tool designed to help traders calculate the risk associated with their trades in the foreign exchange market. The calculator takes into account the trader's account balance, equity percentage, stop loss level, entry point, and profit level. It then calculates the risk based on either the account balance or equity percentage.

The calculator also offers additional features such as profit protection and trailing toggle buttons. Traders can enable profit protection to implement profit protection logic, and disable it when not needed. The tool also allows traders to define profit, stop loss levels, and entry points using drag and drop visual lines. Traders can visualize their trading plan and mitigate potential losses effectively using this tool.

## How it Works

1. The program initializes by setting the initial values for the variables: account balance, equity percentage, stop loss level, entry point, and profit level.

2. The `manageRiskAndProfitability()` function is called to calculate the risk, define levels, visualize the trading plan, and mitigate losses. If profit protection is enabled, the `enableProfitProtection()` function is called; otherwise, the `disableProfitProtection()` function is called.

3. The program enters the main execution loop (`OnTick()`) where the trading logic is implemented. Traders can customize this part of the code to suit their trading strategies.

4. When the program is terminated, the `OnDeinit()` function is called to perform any necessary cleanup.

## Usage

To use the Trading Keys MT4 Forex Risk Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Set the initial values for the variables: `accountBalance`, `equityPercentage`, `stopLossLevel`, `entryPoint`, and `profitLevel`.

2. Call the `manageRiskAndProfitability()` function to calculate the risk, define levels, visualize the trading plan, and mitigate losses.

3. Customize the `OnTick()` function to implement your trading logic.

4. Run the program in your MetaTrader 4 platform.
